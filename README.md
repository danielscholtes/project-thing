This plugin allows for creation of multi-floor procedurally generated dungeons.

Each dungeon floor is created using a premade tileset (each tile can have multiple variations), and then the tiles from the tileset are taken to create a unique dungeon. Loot and mobs are customizable per floor and their locations are customizable per tile.

The plugin has a party system to allow multiple players to play the same dungeon.
